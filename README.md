===========

Symbolic execution for Python applications

Why Use Halfwaytree ?

    It can be installed by simply importing it as a Python module.
        There will be no need to setup any virtual environments.
        This increases the portability of the symbolic execution for Python program.
        This emphasis of Halfwaytree is simplicity so you can focus on testing your code.
    It has no other dependencies except Python and Z3.
    It will work with Python 2.7 and Python 3.
    It will always be open source.

Drawbacks To Halfwaytree

    Phase1 is not done yet. So Halfwaytree is currently unusable.
    There are limitations on the grammar of Python source code which can be symbolically executed.
        The limitations placed on source code will decrease as more phases are developed.
