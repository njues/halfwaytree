	<b>Why Use Halfwaytree ?</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			It can be installed by simply importing it as a Python module.
			<ul>
				<li>
					There will be no need to setup any virtual environments.
				</li>
				<li>
					This increases the portability of the symbolic execution for Python program.
				</li>
				<li>
					This emphasis of Halfwaytree is simplicity so you can focus on testing your code.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			It has no other dependencies except Python and Z3.	
		</li>	 
		<li>
			It will work with Python 2.7 and Python 3.
		</li>
		<li>
			It will always be open source.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<b>Drawbacks To Halfwaytree</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Phase1 is not done yet. So Halfwaytree is currently unusable.
		</li> 
		<li>
			There are<a href="docs/phase1-plan-of-development.html#functionality" target="blank">limitations on the grammar</a> of Python source code which can be symbolically executed.
			<ul>
				<li>
					The limitations placed on source code will decrease as more phases are developed. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Currently, the development is only in Phase1.
				</li>
